# rawrlib

rawr is a 1-bit game framework that uses a unique custom rendering engine to display pixelated graphics. The goal of rawr is for developers to challenge themselves to find creativity in limitation, an idea inspired by the fantasy console [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), and explore avenues they may not have considered with the wide array of modern game development tools available.

The project is dependent on [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.30.6). The 3rd party library is used solely for display and platform abstraction. rawr handles all graphics data structures, algorithms, and other logic internally. No pre-requisite knowledge is required to understand how to set up and start running a project. Simply download SDL2 from the link above, clone this repository, and start experimenting!

rawr makes it easy for a beginner in the C programming language to dive into game development with little prior experience. The functional design and flow of rawr makes it easy and intuitive to understand for programmers of all backgrounds. It is an excellent framework to learn either as a old-fashioned arcade developer or someone new to C programming and game development.
